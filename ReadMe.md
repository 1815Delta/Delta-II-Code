These are the files throughout the years of Delta II - Scorpion 3.0
I hope you enjoy these files, because they had a lot of effort into them.
Here is the information of the three codes:
1. The first one is a catapult robot, which also includes automatic down position as well as gyroscope-based drive
2. The second one was an extremely basic program for Scorpion 2.0, which was focusing on simplicity
3. The third one was supposed to implement a bit more advanced programming to improve the performance of the robot.
All 3 codes has PI control for something, and the manipulators were pure automatic that auto-positions.
Hope you enjoy :)
